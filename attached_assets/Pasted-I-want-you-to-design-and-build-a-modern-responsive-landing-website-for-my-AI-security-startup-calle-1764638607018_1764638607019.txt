I want you to design and build a modern, responsive landing website for my AI security startup called “VigilanceX”.

What we do:
VigilanceX builds AI-powered surveillance and video analytics for real-time threat detection, anomaly detection, and safety monitoring for offices, factories, and smart cities.

Overall style:

Very clean, futuristic, cyber-security vibe

Dark theme with accent highlight colors

Smooth animations and subtle hover effects

Design quality and layout inspired by major cybersecurity / AI SaaS companies (similar feel to leading brands, but do NOT copy any exact text, logos, or assets).

Page structure (single page website):

Hero Section (top)

Big headline: “AI-Powered Surveillance. Relentless Vigilance.”

Subtext explaining VigilanceX in 2–3 lines.

Call-to-action buttons: “Book a Demo” and “Contact Us”.

Background with abstract AI / security / network graphics.

About VigilanceX

Short paragraph about the company’s mission and what makes us different.

3–4 bullet points for core values: Real-time monitoring, Accuracy, Privacy-aware, Enterprise-ready.

Key Features Section

Use cards or icons to show features like:

Intelligent Threat Detection

Behavior & Anomaly Analysis

Industrial Safety Monitoring

Smart Alerts & Dashboards

Each feature should have a short description.

Use Cases / Solutions Section

Tiles or columns for:

Smart Cities

Corporate Offices & Campuses

Factories & Warehouses

Retail & Malls

Each with a brief explanation.

Social Proof / “Trusted By” Placeholder

Area where I can later add logos of companies.

For now, use neutral placeholder logos or simple shapes.

Contact Section

Simple contact form with fields: Name, Email, Company, Message.

Also show direct contact info:

Email: contact@vigilancex.com
 (placeholder)

Phone: +91-XXXXXXXXXX (placeholder)

Location: India

Footer

Company name, short tagline

Links: Home, About, Solutions, Contact

Copyright text

Chatbot requirement:

Add a small chatbot widget at the bottom-right of the site.

On click, it opens a small chat window with a welcome message like:
“Hi, I’m the VigilanceX Assistant. How can I help you today?”

It should allow basic Q&A (even if responses are rule-based or placeholder for now).

Technical details:

Make it responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Use clean, well-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React if you support it).

Keep content easy for me to edit later (text in clear sections).

Output the complete code and any setup instructions I need to run the website locally or host it.
